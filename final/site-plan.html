    <!--How about a "Dream Car Showcase" website?
    Home Page: A welcome message introducing the site, explaining that it highlights a cool car (your dream car or a 
    famous one). You could include a large image of the car and some basic details like its name, manufacturer, and 
    top speed.
    Child Page: A more detailed page with specifications (engine type, horsepower, price, etc.), history, and f
    un facts about the car. You could also use JavaScript to add an interactive feature, like a button that changes 
    the car's color or displays different angles of the car.

    The plan is to make it about the c8 corvette

			<p>Development and Background
				For decades, Chevrolet engineers toyed with the idea of a mid-engine Corvette to improve handling and performance. Corvette chief engineer Zora Arkus-Duntov was an early advocate for this layout, but cost and production challenges prevented it from becoming a reality for many years.
				By the late 2010s, Chevrolet finally committed to the idea, aiming to push the Corvette into supercar territory while keeping it relatively affordable compared to European rivals.
				Launch and Models
				C8 Corvette Stingray (2020–Present)
				* Unveiled on July 18, 2019, the 2020 Corvette Stingray debuted as the first mid-engine Corvette.
				* Engine: 6.2L LT2 V8, producing 490 hp (495 hp with Z51 package).
				* Performance: 0-60 mph in 2.9 seconds (with Z51 Performance Package).
				* Transmission: First Corvette to use an 8-speed dual-clutch automatic (no manual option).
				* Interior: Driver-focused cockpit with a 12-inch digital instrument cluster and a modern infotainment system.https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.motortrend.com%2Fnews%2F2024-chevrolet-corvette-e-ray-pros-cons-review%2F&psig=AOvVaw1CJ8-PC2jVpBq9kuQ1Nzs4&ust=1742495504234000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBQQjRxqFwoTCKD309_jlowDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAJ
				C8 Corvette Z06 (2023–Present)
				* Naturally aspirated 5.5L LT6 V8 with a flat-plane crank.
				* Produces 670 hp, making it the most powerful naturally aspirated V8 in a production car.
				* Rev limit: 8,600 RPM, inspired by race cars.
				* More aggressive aerodynamics and a wider stance than the Stingray.
				C8 Corvette E-Ray (2024–Present)
				* First-ever hybrid, all-wheel-drive Corvette.
				* Combines the LT2 V8 with an electric motor for a total of 655 hp.
				* Can drive in stealth mode (electric-only) for short distances.
				* 0-60 mph in 2.5 seconds, making it the quickest Corvette ever.
				Impact and Legacy
				* The mid-engine layout places the C8 in direct competition with exotic supercars like Ferrari, Lamborghini, and McLaren.
				* It retains the Corvette’s tradition of high performance at a relatively affordable price (starting around $65,000 for the base model).
				* The introduction of hybrid technology and AWD marks a shift in Corvette’s future, possibly paving the way for electrification.
